Welcome to the DefectPX documentation! We're glad you're here and can't wait to show you around.

## What is DefectPX?

DefectPX allows you to easily check for dead or defective pixels on LCD monitors. Useful to test monitors before purchasing, or during the warranty period. DefectPX comes with multi-monitor support, and a very intuitive interface.

## Starting DefectPX

If you have installed DefectPX using the [installer](/defectpx/download/#installer), you can start DefectPX from the **Start Menu**.

If you are using the [portable version](/defectpx/download/#portable), simply launch the **DefectPX.exe** file from the directory where you have unzipped the DefectPX files.
